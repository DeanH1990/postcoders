# put your "I would have done this with more time"-style comments here

## With more time I would have completed task 4 and 5.

## I spent too long trying to get an error handler working for task 3 but couldnt get it working and wanted to move on to the next task. This didnt leave me enough time to research the MUI Card package properly.
## The Cards currently do not render, using the source code from the documentation renders one card. With more time I would have mapped through the areas array to display all the area cards.
## Had I got the cards rendering properly I would have done a minimal amount of CSS changes to make the page functional.
## Depending on the scope of the project I also would have refactored the api requests to create a base URL if there were to be any other types of requests.

## Once all tasks were completed I would spend time making changes to the appearance of the app.
